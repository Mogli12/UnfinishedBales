# UnfinishedBales for Farming Simulator 2019

## How to download?

Just click here: [Latest version](https://github.com/Mogli12/UnfinishedBales/blob/master/FS19_UnfinishedBales.zip?raw=true)

## Motivation
I found it annoying to drive until the baler had exaclty 100% fill level. This small script allows you to unload bales already at 75% fill level.

## Description

## Developer version
Please be aware you're using a developer version, which may and will contain errors, bugs, mistakes and unfinished code. 

You have been warned.

If you're still ok with this, please remember to post possible issues that you find in the developer version. 
That's the only way we can find sources of error and fix them. 
Be as specific as possible:

* tell us the version number
* only use the vehicles necessary, not 10 other ones at a time
* which vehicles are involved, what is the intended action?
* Post! The! Log! to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or [PasteBin](http://pastebin.com/)

From today on I will close all new issues without the above information!
